Security
========
The two main security components you will use with the
Python driver are Authentication and SSL.

Authentication
--------------
Versions 2.0 and higher of the driver support a SASL-based
authentication mechanism.  To use this authentication, set
:attr:`~.Cluster.auth_provider` to an instance of a subclass
of :class:`~cassandra.auth.AuthProvider`.  When working
with Cassandra's ``PasswordAuthenticator``, you can use
the :class:`~cassandra.auth.PlainTextAuthProvider` class.

For example, suppose Cassandra is setup with its default
'cassandra' user with a password of 'cassandra':

.. code-block:: python

    from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
    from cassandra.auth import PlainTextAuthProvider

    auth_provider = PlainTextAuthProvider(username='cassandra', password='cassandra')
    cluster = Cluster(auth_provider=auth_provider, protocol_version=3)


Custom Authenticators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're using something other than Cassandra's ``PasswordAuthenticator``,
:class:`~.SaslAuthProvider` is provided for generic SASL authentication mechanisms,
utilizing the ``pure-sasl`` package.
If these do not suit your needs, you may need to create your own subclasses of
:class:`~.AuthProvider` and :class:`~.Authenticator`.  You can use the Sasl classes
as example implementations.

SSL
---
To enable SSL you will need to set :attr:`.Cluster.ssl_options` to a
dict of options.  These will be passed as kwargs to ``ssl.wrap_socket()``
when new sockets are created.  This should be used when client encryption
is enabled in Cassandra.

By default, a ``ca_certs`` value should be supplied (the value should be
a string pointing to the location of the CA certs file), and you probably
want to specify ``ssl_version`` as ``ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1`` to match
Cassandra's default protocol.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
    from ssl import PROTOCOL_TLSv1, CERT_REQUIRED

    ssl_opts = {
        'ca_certs': '/path/to/my/ca.certs',
        'ssl_version': PROTOCOL_TLSv1,
        'cert_reqs': CERT_REQUIRED  # Certificates are required and validated
    }
    cluster = Cluster(ssl_options=ssl_opts)

This is only an example to show how to pass the ssl parameters. Consider reading
the `python ssl documentation <https://docs.python.org/2/library/ssl.html#ssl.wrap_socket>`_ for
your configuration. For further reading, Andrew Mussey has published a thorough guide on
`Using SSL with the DataStax Python driver <http://blog.amussey.com/post/64036730812/cassandra-2-0-client-server-ssl-with-datastax-python>`_.
