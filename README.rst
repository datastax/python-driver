Apache Cassandra Python Driver
==============================

A modern, `feature-rich <https://github.com/datastax/python-driver#features>`_ and highly-tunable Python client library for Apache Cassandra (2.1+) and
DataStax Enterprise (4.7+) using exclusively Cassandra's binary protocol and Cassandra Query Language v3.

The driver supports Python 3.9 through 3.13.

**Note:** DataStax products do not support big-endian systems.

Features
--------
* `Synchronous <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/api/cassandra/cluster/index.html#cassandra.cluster.Session.execute>`_ and `Asynchronous <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/api/cassandra/cluster/index.html#cassandra.cluster.Session.execute_async>`_ APIs
* `Simple, Prepared, and Batch statements <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/api/cassandra/query/index.html#cassandra.query.Statement>`_
* Asynchronous IO, parallel execution, request pipelining
* `Connection pooling <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/api/cassandra/cluster/index.html#cassandra.cluster.Cluster.get_core_connections_per_host>`_
* Automatic node discovery
* `Automatic reconnection <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/api/cassandra/policies/index.html#reconnecting-to-dead-hosts>`_
* Configurable `load balancing <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/api/cassandra/policies/index.html#load-balancing>`_ and `retry policies <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/api/cassandra/policies/index.html#retrying-failed-operations>`_
* `Concurrent execution utilities <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/api/cassandra/concurrent/index.html>`_
* `Object mapper <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/object_mapper/>`_
* `Connecting to DataStax Astra database (cloud) <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/cloud/>`_
* DSE Graph execution API
* DSE Geometric type serialization
* DSE PlainText and GSSAPI authentication

Object Mapper
-------------
cqlengine (originally developed by Blake Eggleston and Jon Haddad, with contributions from the
community) is now maintained as an integral part of this package. Refer to
`documentation here <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/object_mapper/index.html>`_.

Contributing
------------
See `CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/datastax/python-driver/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.

Error Handling
--------------
While originally written for the Java driver, users may reference the `Cassandra error handling done right blog <https://www.datastax.com/blog/cassandra-error-handling-done-right>`_ for resolving error handling scenarios with Apache Cassandra.

Reporting Problems
------------------
Please report any bugs and make any feature requests on the
`JIRA <https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/PYTHON>`_ issue tracker.
