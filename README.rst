DataStax Python Driver for Apache Cassandra (Beta)
==================================================
A Python client driver for Apache Cassandra.  This driver works exclusively
with the Cassandra Query Language v3 (CQL3) and Cassandra's native
protocol.  As such, only Cassandra 1.2+ is supported.

**Warning**

This driver is currently under heavy development, so the API and layout of
packages, modules, classes, and functions are subject to change.  There may
also be serious bugs, so usage in a production environment is *not*
recommended at this time.

* `JIRA <https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/PYTHON>`_
* `Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/a/lists.datastax.com/forum/#!forum/python-driver-user>`_
* IRC: #datastax-drivers on irc.freenode.net (you can use `freenode's web-based client <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#datastax-drivers>`_)
* `API Documentation <http://datastax.github.io/python-driver/api/index.html>`_

Features to be Added
--------------------
* C extension for encoding/decoding messages
* Authentication/security feature support
* Twisted, gevent support
* Python 3 support
* IPv6 Support

Installation
------------
A package hasn't been put on pypi yet, so for now, run:

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo pip install futures  # install dependency
      $ sudo python setup.py install

libev support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The driver currently uses Python's ``asyncore`` module for its default
event loop.  For better performance, ``libev`` is also supported through
the ``pyev`` python wrapper.

Linux
^^^^^

If you're on Linux, you should be able to install libev
through a package manager.  For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo apt-get install libev4

and then install ``pyev`` as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo pip install --no-install pyev==0.8.1-4.04
      $ sudo chmod +x build/pyev/src/libev/configure
      $ sudo pip install pyev==0.8.1-4.04

OS X
^^^^

If you're on Mac OS X, you should be able to install libev
through `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_. For example, on Mac OS X:

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ brew install libev

and then install ``pyev`` as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ pip install pyev

Usage
^^^^^

If successful, you should be able to use the libev event loop by
doing the following

    .. code-block:: python

      >>> from cassandra.io.libevreactor import LibevConnection
      >>> from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

      >>> cluster = Cluster()
      >>> cluster.connection_class = LibevConnection
      >>> session = cluster.connect()
