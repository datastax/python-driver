DataStax Driver for Apache Cassandra
====================================

A modern, `feature-rich <https://github.com/datastax/python-driver#features>`_ and highly-tunable Python client library for Apache Cassandra (2.1+) and
DataStax Enterprise (4.7+) using exclusively Cassandra's binary protocol and Cassandra Query Language v3.

The driver supports Python 3.9 through 3.13.

**Note:** DataStax products do not support big-endian systems.

Object Mapper
-------------
cqlengine (originally developed by Blake Eggleston and Jon Haddad, with contributions from the
community) is now maintained as an integral part of this package. Refer to
`documentation here <https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/object_mapper/index.html>`_.

Contributing
------------
See `CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/datastax/python-driver/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.

Error Handling
--------------
While originally written for the Java driver, users may reference the `Cassandra error handling done right blog <https://www.datastax.com/blog/cassandra-error-handling-done-right>`_ for resolving error handling scenarios with Apache Cassandra.

Reporting Problems
------------------
Please report any bugs and make any feature requests on the
`JIRA <https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/PYTHON>`_ issue tracker.
