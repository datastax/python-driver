Releasing
=========
* Run the tests and ensure they all pass
* Update CHANGELOG.rst
  * Check for any missing entries
  * Add today's date to the release section
* Update the version in ``cassandra/__init__.py``
  * For beta releases, use a version like ``(2, 1, '0b1')``
  * For release candidates, use a version like ``(2, 1, '0rc1')``
  * When in doubt, follow PEP 440 versioning
* Add the new version in ``docs.yaml``
* Commit the changelog and version changes, e.g. ``git commit -m'version 1.0.0'``
* Tag the release.  For example: ``git tag -a 1.0.0 -m 'version 1.0.0'``
* Push the tag and new ``master``: ``git push origin 1.0.0 ; git push origin master``
* Update the `python-driver` submodule of `python-driver-wheels`,
  commit then push. This will trigger TravisCI and the wheels building.
* For a GA release, upload the package to pypi::

    # Clean the working directory
    python setup.py clean
    rm dist/*

    # Build the source distribution
    python setup.py sdist

    # Download all wheels from the jfrog repository and copy them in
    # the dist/ directory
    cp /path/to/wheels/*.whl dist/

    # Upload all files
    twine upload dist/*

* On pypi, make the latest GA the only visible version
* Update the docs (see below)
* Append a 'postN' string to the version tuple in ``cassandra/__init__.py``
  so that it looks like ``(x, y, z, 'postN')``

  * After a beta or rc release, this should look like ``(2, 1, '0b1', 'post0')``

* After the release has been tagged, add a section to docs.yaml with the new tag ref::

    versions:
      - name: <version name>
        ref: <release tag>

* Commit and push
* Update 'cassandra-test' branch to reflect new release

    * this is typically a matter of merging or rebasing onto master
    * test and push updated branch to origin

* Update the JIRA versions: https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/plugins/servlet/project-config/PYTHON/versions

  * add release dates and set version as "released"

* Make an announcement on the mailing list

Building the Docs
=================
Sphinx is required to build the docs. You probably want to install through apt,
if possible::

    sudo apt-get install python-sphinx

pip may also work::

    sudo pip install -U Sphinx

To build the docs, run::

    python setup.py doc

Upload the Docs
=================

This is deprecated. The docs is now only published on https://docs.datastax.com.

To upload the docs, checkout the ``gh-pages`` branch and copy the entire
contents all of ``docs/_build/X.Y.Z/*`` into the root of the ``gh-pages`` branch
and then push that branch to github.

For example::

    git checkout 1.0.0
    python setup.py doc
    git checkout gh-pages
    cp -R docs/_build/1.0.0/* .
    git add --update  # add modified files
    # Also make sure to add any new documentation files!
    git commit -m 'Update docs (version 1.0.0)'
    git push origin gh-pages

If docs build includes errors, those errors may not show up in the next build unless
you have changed the files with errors.  It's good to occassionally clear the build
directory and build from scratch::

    rm -rf docs/_build/*

Documentor
==========
We now also use another tool called Documentor with Sphinx source to build docs.
This gives us versioned docs with nice integrated search. This is a private tool
of DataStax.

Dependencies
------------
Sphinx
~~~~~~
Installed as described above

Documentor
~~~~~~~~~~
Clone and setup Documentor as specified in `the project <https://github.com/riptano/documentor#installation-and-quick-start>`_.
This tool assumes Ruby, bundler, and npm are present.

Building
--------
The setup script expects documentor to be in the system path. You can either add it permanently or run with something
like this::

    PATH=$PATH:<documentor repo>/bin python setup.py doc

The docs will not display properly just browsing the filesystem in a browser. To view the docs as they would be in most
web servers, use the SimpleHTTPServer module::

    cd docs/_build/
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then, browse to `localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`_.

Tests
=====

Running Unit Tests
------------------
Unit tests can be run like so::

    pytest tests/unit/

You can run a specific test method like so::

    pytest tests/unit/test_connection.py::ConnectionTest::test_bad_protocol_version

Running Integration Tests
-------------------------
In order to run integration tests, you must specify a version to run using the ``CASSANDRA_VERSION`` or ``DSE_VERSION`` environment variable::

    CASSANDRA_VERSION=2.0.9 pytest tests/integration/standard

Or you can specify a cassandra directory (to test unreleased versions)::

    CASSANDRA_DIR=/path/to/cassandra pytest tests/integration/standard/

Specifying the usage of an already running Cassandra cluster
------------------------------------------------------------
The test will start the appropriate Cassandra clusters when necessary  but if you don't want this to happen because a Cassandra cluster is already running the flag ``USE_CASS_EXTERNAL`` can be used, for example::

    USE_CASS_EXTERNAL=1 CASSANDRA_VERSION=2.0.9 pytest tests/integration/standard

Specify a Protocol Version for Tests
------------------------------------
The protocol version defaults to 1 for cassandra 1.2 and 2 otherwise.  You can explicitly set
it with the ``PROTOCOL_VERSION`` environment variable::

    PROTOCOL_VERSION=3 pytest tests/integration/standard

Testing Multiple Python Versions
--------------------------------
Use tox to test all of Python 3.8 through 3.12 and pypy (this is what TravisCI runs)::

    tox

By default, tox only runs the unit tests.

Running the Benchmarks
======================
There needs to be a version of cassandra running locally so before running the benchmarks, if ccm is installed:
	
	ccm create benchmark_cluster -v 3.0.1 -n 1 -s

To run the benchmarks, pick one of the files under the ``benchmarks/`` dir and run it::

    python benchmarks/future_batches.py

There are a few options.  Use ``--help`` to see them all::

    python benchmarks/future_batches.py --help

Packaging for Cassandra
=======================
A source distribution is included in Cassandra, which uses the driver internally for ``cqlsh``.
To package a released version, checkout the tag and build a source zip archive::

    python setup.py sdist --formats=zip

If packaging a pre-release (untagged) version, it is useful to include a commit hash in the archive
name to specify the built version::

    python setup.py egg_info -b-`git rev-parse --short HEAD` sdist --formats=zip

The file (``dist/cassandra-driver-<version spec>.zip``) is packaged with Cassandra in ``cassandra/lib/cassandra-driver-internal-only*zip``.

Releasing an EAP
================

An EAP release is only uploaded on a private server and it is not published on pypi.

* Clean the environment::

    python setup.py clean

* Package the source distribution::

    python setup.py sdist

* Test the source distribution::

    pip install dist/cassandra-driver-<version>.tar.gz

* Upload the package on the EAP download server.
* Build the documentation::

    python setup.py doc

* Upload the docs on the EAP download server.

Adding a New Python Runtime Support
===================================

* Add the new python version to our jenkins image:
  https://github.com/riptano/openstack-jenkins-drivers/

* Add the new python version in the Jenkinsfile and TravisCI configs as appropriate

* Run the tests and ensure they all pass
  * also test all event loops

* Update the wheels building repo to support that version:
  https://github.com/datastax/python-driver-wheels
