Driver Examples
===============
This directory will contain a set of scripts demonstrating driver APIs or integration techniques. It will not be exhaustive, but will contain examples where they are too involved, or
open-ended to include inline in the docstrings. In that case, they should be referenced from the docstrings

Features
--------
* `request_init_listener.py <request_init_listener.py>`_ A script demonstrating how to register a session request listener and use it to track alternative metrics about requests (size, for example).
