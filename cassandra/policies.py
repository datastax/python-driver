class DowngradingConsistencyRetryPolicy(RetryPolicy):
    """
    A retry policy that sometimes retries with a lower consistency level than
    the one initially requested.

    **BEWARE**: This policy may retry queries using a lower consistency
    level than the one initially requested. By doing so, it may break
    consistency guarantees. In other words, if you use this retry policy,
    there are cases (documented below) where a read at :attr:`~.QUORUM`
    *may not* see a preceding write at :attr:`~.QUORUM`. Do not use this
    policy unless you have understood the cases where this can happen and
    are ok with that. It is also recommended to subclass this class so
    that queries that required a consistency level downgrade can be
    recorded (so that repairs can be made later, etc).

    This policy implements the same retries as :class:`.RetryPolicy`,
    but on top of that, it also retries in the following cases:

    * On a read timeout: if the number of replicas that responded is
      greater than one but lower than is required by the requested
      consistency level, the operation is retried at a lower consistency
      level.
    * On a write timeout: if the operation is an :attr:`~.UNLOGGED_BATCH`
      and at least one replica acknowledged the write, the operation is
      retried at a lower consistency level.  Furthermore, for other
      write types, if at least one replica acknowledged the write, the
      timeout is ignored.
    * On an unavailable exception: if at least one replica is alive, the
      operation is retried at a lower consistency level.

    The reasoning behind this retry policy is as follows: if, based
    on the information the Cassandra coordinator node returns, retrying the
    operation with the initially requested consistency has a chance to
    succeed, do it. Otherwise, if based on that information we know the
    initially requested consistency level cannot be achieved currently, then:

    * For writes, ignore the exception (thus silently failing the
      consistency requirement) if we know the write has been persisted on at
      least one replica.
    * For reads, try reading at a lower consistency level (thus silently
      failing the consistency requirement).

    In other words, this policy implements the idea that if the requested
    consistency level cannot be achieved, the next best thing for writes is
    to make sure the data is persisted, and that reading something is better
    than reading nothing, even if there is a risk of reading stale data.
